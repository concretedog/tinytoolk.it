Tiny sewing kits are super useful to carry, I make these small sewn cases which fold in half with a small felt section for pins and needles.

## Case

{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/Concretedogs_travel_sewing_kit/original_in_hand_cropped.jpg", caption="The original kit") }}

{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/Concretedogs_travel_sewing_kit/main_rotated.jpg", caption="My usual contents") }}


{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/Concretedogs_travel_sewing_kit/back_paracord.jpg", caption="A few hand stitches through a short length of paracord make a good tie wrap") }}


{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/Concretedogs_travel_sewing_kit/serens_open_full.jpg", caption="This machine stitched case is for my daughter to take to Uni, has roughly the same contents as mine") }}


The case is a simple pocket with foldover lid, inside the lid I line with a small rectangle of felt.
The felt gives a place for storage of pins and needles.
A small length of paracord is sewn into the case back which can be used as a tie.
Optionally my original kit has a small piece of cord stitched to the inside which I clip the swiss army knife too to prevent loss in the field.
